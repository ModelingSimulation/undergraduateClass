## Welcome to our website

Here, we will post some useful example code and notes.  It is not required for you to work with this code, but it may be helpful for getting started.  For Fall 2018, the instructors were [Charlie Peskin](https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/peskin/) and [Charles Puelz](https://cpuelz.github.io/).  For Fall 2019, the instructors are [Charlie Peskin](https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/peskin/) and Guanhua Sun. This class is associated with the [Modeling and Simulation RTG grant](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/research/pages/research-and-training-group-mathematical-modeling-and-simulation/) here at Courant.

### Code

-Harmonic Oscillator: [oscillator_harmonic_2d.m](harmonic_oscillator_2d.m), [force_spr.m](force_spr.m)

-building some structures: [simple_structure_2d.m](simple_structure_2d.m), [simple_structure_3d.m](simple_structure_3d.m)

-building a bicycle: [bicycle.m](bicycle.m)

-2d forward Euler example with a chain of springs: [spring_string.m](spring_string.m)

-2d bouncing ball: [bouncing_ball.m](bouncing_ball.m).  Try varying the spring and dashpot parameters to see how this impacts the dynamics.  Be careful, the set of parameters in this file are close to being unstable with forward Euler :-).

-rigid bodies: [rigid_body.m](rigid_body.m)

-falling cone: [falling_cone.m](falling_cone.m)

### Notes

Here is a link to some [notes](notes_MATH395.pdf) that will be regularly updated.  These are still a work in progress.

Here are some of Charlie's hand written notes:

-[Mass action](mass_action.pdf)

-[Principle of detailed balance](principle_of_detailed_balance.pdf)

-[Equations of motion for a gyrocompass](gyrocompass.pdf)

-[Enzyme kinetics](enzyme_kinetics.pdf)

-[Paper on cellular circadian rhythm](WangPeskinPhysRevE.97.062416.pdf)

-[A genetic switch](genetic_switch.pdf)

-[Hemoglobin](hemeoglobin.pdf) and an [old paper](monod_wyman_changeaux_allosteric.pdf) about it.

-[Traffic flow](traffic_simulation_notes.pdf)

-[Feedback](feedback_notes.pdf)

### Student projects from Fall 2018

Here is a [beautiful project](gyroscope_Final_Paper.pdf) from Zeshun Zong and Yifeng Chen and gyroscopes and their applications.  You can find their code in [this repo](https://github.com/zeshunzong/A_series_of_experiments_based_on_gyroscope).
